# Awesome Not Persuasive Or Not Very Persuasive

A curated list for awesome Internet resources and generic things that are completely not persuasive or not very persuasive.

## Why I have created this repo

I've always desired to define a set of things that for me are not persuasives. We live in the era of massive home entertainment, we have to deal with systems equipped with artificial intelligence and for those reasons it is better to for these reasons I believe it can be useful to have an overview of what is pure.

But, what is pure? I have spent a lot of time trying to find the right definition of pure trying to find some points.

I think that the definition of pure, in relation of Internet resources and general things, is related the a low capacity to control people mind in order to increase dependence e aderence to a capitalistic money system.

I decided to divide things in three categories:

* Not Persuasive Things
* Not Very Persuasive Things
* Persuasive Things

Persuasive things are not listed into this repo because because they are too many and I do not know anything about legal implications about mentioning things like a companies or products defined "persuasives". Not very persuasive things are described here because I think that a resource can use a small percentage of persuasion in order to allow the world to know it.
